# Lesson 2: Controllers (Teacher Notes)

This is teacher guide for lesson 2 Controller.
It incldues tips and teaching strategies for creating sprites

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will:
- ✅ Understand how to use all controller inputs in MakeCode Arcade
- ✅ Create sprites and move them using the D-pad
- ✅ Program button press and release events
- ✅ Trigger sounds, messages, and projectiles
- ✅ Detect any button press to control the game background

## Suggested Lesson Flow
**Step 1 - Create New Project**
  - Demonstrate how to open MakeCode Arcade in the browser.
  - Encourage students to name their project meaningfully (e.g. Controller Features Demo).

**Step 2 - Create the Player Sprites**
  - Explain what sprites are (the visual characters in games).
  - Have students design simple characters using the pixel editor.

**Step 3 - Move Sprites with the Controller**
  - Introduce the concept of connecting the controller to sprite movement.
  - Emphasize velocity (vx, vy) as speed in x and y directions.

**Step 4 - A Button: Shoot Projectile**
  - Demonstrate cause and effect: pressing A creates an action.
  - Encourage creativity in projectile design.

**Step 5 - B Button: Jump**
  - Discuss how vy controls vertical movement.
  - Explain the idea of setting bounce on walls for fun interactions.

**Step 6 - Direction Buttons**
  - Reinforce that each direction button can trigger a separate event.
  - Use this to teach event-driven programming.

**Step 7 - Released Events**
  - Introduce the difference between “pressed” and “released”.
  - Let students experiment to see how these events differ in timing.

**Step 8 - Menu Button (Pause Message)**
  - Explain the menu button as a “pause” or “info” control.
  - Encourage students to customize messages.

**Step 9 - Any Button Changes Background**
  - This demonstrates logic and conditionals.
  - Students practice using if-then-else and game update.

**Student Activity (20-25 mins)**
- Students follow [Student Instructions](student.md)
